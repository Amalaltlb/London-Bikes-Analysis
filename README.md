# London Bike Analysis

## Overview

This project involves developing a dynamic dashboard using **Tableau** to analyze the London bikes rides dataset. It uncovers usage patterns through visualizations of total bike rides and moving averages over time, while also examining the impact of weather conditions with a heat map comparing temperature and wind speed against bike usage by hour. This comprehensive approach allows for insights into seasonal trends and factors influencing bike usage.

## Dataset

- **Raw Data:** `london_merged.csv` – Original unprocessed data.
- **Cleaned Data:** `london_bikes_final.xlsx` – Cleaned and structured data used for analysis.

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**
  - **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
    - Used `pandas` for data manipulation.
    - Mapped numerical codes to descriptive labels for weather conditions and seasons.
    - Adjusted humidity values to actual percentages.
    - Exported cleaned data to Excel for use in Tableau.

- **Tableau**
  - **Data Analysis and Visualization**
    - Created interactive visualizations to illustrate bike-rides patterns.
    - Implemented filters and interactive elements for deeper insights.
  - **Dashboard Creation**
    - Built an interactive dashboard to display key metrics and trends.
    - Applied formatting techniques to enhance visual appeal.
 
## How to Use

1. **Explore the Cleaned Data:**
   - Open `london_bikes_final.xlsx` to review the prepared data.

2. **Load the Tableau Dashboard:**
   - Open `London Bikes Dashboard.twb` using **Tableau Desktop**.

3. **Interact with the Dashboard:**
   - Use filters to explore different aspects of the data.
   - Analyze trends and patterns in rental usage.
